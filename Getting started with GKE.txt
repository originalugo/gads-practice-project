Lab - Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

Objectives:
- Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.
- Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.


Task 2: confirm that the needed APIs are enabled
- first we need to set the project ID
  gcloud config set project qwiklabs-gcp-01-9aa0057e9334

- next we need to verify which API services can be enabled
  gcloud services list --available

- then we enable the Kubernetes Engine API
  gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com

- next we enable the Container Registry API
  gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com

Task 3: Start a kubernetes engine cluster

1. creating a variable to store the zone of choice
   export MY_ZONE= us-central1-a

2. starting a kubernetes cluster managed by kubernetes engine
   gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

3. to check the version of kubernetes
   kubectl version

4. to view the running nodes


Task 4: Run and deploy a container

1. launch a single instance of an nginx container
   kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

2. view the pod running the ngin container
   kubectl get pods

3. expose the nginx container to the internet
   kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

4. to view the number of services
   kubectl get services

5. to scale up the number of pods running on yur service
   kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

6. to confirm that kubernetes has updated the number of pods
   kubectl get pods

7. to view the number of services and confirm that the external IP has not changed
   kubectl get services
